""" What follows is a rough outline of what needs to be implemented. First note that Blendenpik needs to have
some functions programed to operate with it. Most importantly is a preconditioner along with several other functions for comparison
We also need to analyze the coherence of matrices which means there needs to be a function to calculate it in the first place
we should also generate various plots and perhaps could use a function to handle the plot heavy lifting."""

"""Once again I will say that the paper is rather straighforward but doesn't really do a whole lot, and the code I mention above has lots of
moving parts we might be able to figure out and make our own. To even really start this project we desperately need the code to execute the
method in the first place"""
